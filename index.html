  <p class="title">Project 1: USM Planetarium Logo</p>
<img src="images/letendre.png">
<p>Project Statement: My design for the Southworth Planetarium logo was inspired by Maine's wilderness, reflecting the state's forest and mountain landscapes. I created a simple logo, featuring a balanced and refined design that aligns with the planetarium's location.  This project has been a valuable learning experience in understanding compositional balance, shape, and color to create a cohesive design.</p>

<p class="title">Project 2: Photo Manipulation</p>
<img src="images/LetendreAlyssa_Cryptids.png">
<p>Project Statement: For the infamous Maine's "Spector Moose," I used an exploration of information and sketches to inform my design, which aimed to combine realism with an eerie atmosphere. To create mystery and tension, I embraced the "caught on tape" narrative. The final image reflects my exploration of photo manipulation and my effort to evoke a chilling atmosphere through a narrative-driven design.</p>

<p> Project Statement: Cats & War — Is a video arts project that reflects the issue of internet video desensitization and the uncanny way life imitates art. The idea of this work came from my experience of seeing violent war videos alongside silly cat video on the Internet. My video combines clips of American wars (WWII, Iraq, and Afghanistan) with silly cat videos. I aimed to have viewers feel the same confusion and unease that I felt when faced with these extreme contrasts  in videos online.</p>

<p> Project Statement: This work explores the relationship between contemporary technology and space, as this interactive projection highlights how today’s technology supports the view of space. The idea is to experiment with how the view of space can take up physical space.  By interacting with motion sensor technology, a view of space is projected, offering a similar imitation of a planetarium.  </p>
